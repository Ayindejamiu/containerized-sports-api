# Sports API Management System

## **Project Overview**
This project demonstrates building a containerized API management system for querying sports data. It leverages **Amazon ECS (Fargate)** for running containers, **Amazon API Gateway** for exposing REST endpoints, and an external **Sports API** for real-time sports data. The project showcases advanced cloud computing practices, including API management, container orchestration, and secure AWS integrations.
